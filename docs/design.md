## Concept

Datumaro is:
- a tool to build composite datasets and iterate over them
- a tool to create and maintain datasets
  - Version control of annotations and images
  - Publication (with removal of sensitive information)
  - Editing
  - Joining and splitting
  - Exporting, format changing
  - Image preprocessing
- a dataset storage
- a tool to debug datasets
  - A network can be used to generate
    informative data subsets (e.g. with false-positives)
    to be analyzed further

### Requirements

- User interfaces
  - a library
  - a console tool with visualization means
- Targets: single datasets, composite datasets, single images / videos
- Built-in support for well-known annotation formats and datasets:
    CVAT, COCO, PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, ImageNet
- Extensibility with user-provided components
- Lightweightness - it should be easy to start working with Datumaro
  - Minimal dependency on environment and configuration
  - It should be easier to use Datumaro than writing own code
    for computation of statistics or dataset manipulations

### Functionality and ideas

- Blur sensitive areas on dataset images
- Dataset annotation filters, relabelling etc.
- Dataset augmentation
- Calculation of statistics:
  - Mean & std, custom stats
- "Edit" command to modify annotations
- Versioning (for images, annotations, subsets, sources etc., comparison)
- Documentation generation
- Provision of iterators for user code
- Dataset downloading
- Dataset generation
- Dataset building (export in a specific format, indexation, statistics, documentation)
- Dataset exporting to other formats
- Dataset debugging (run inference, generate dataset slices, compute statistics)
- "Explainable AI" - highlight network attention areas ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04592))
  - Black-box approach
    - Classification, Detection, Segmentation, Captioning
    - White-box approach

### Research topics

- exploration of network prediction uncertainty (aka Bayessian approach)
  Use case: explanation of network "quality", "stability", "certainty"
- adversarial attacks on networks
- dataset minification / reduction
  Use case: removal of redundant information to reach the same network quality with lesser training time
- dataset expansion and filtration of additions
  Use case: add only important data
- guidance for key frame selection for tracking ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11779))
  Use case: more effective annotation, better predictions

## RC 1 vision

*CVAT integration*

Datumaro needs to be integrated with [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat),
extending CVAT UI capabilities regarding task and project operations.
It should be capable of downloading and processing data from CVAT.
