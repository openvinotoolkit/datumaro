# General

After importing the datasets you wish to inspect, you'll be presented with the following screen:

![General Tab](../../../../images/gui/multiple/general_tab.png)

You can review the paths and formats of the first and second datasets, confirming where they are located and in what format they are. Additionally, you can obtain rough information about each dataset. You'll see the subsets within each dataset, along with the number of items in each subset. Furthermore, you can view the categories present in the entire dataset and the number of annotations corresponding to each category. Through the gallery, you can directly examine some items from each dataset.

If you desire more detailed information about each dataset, I recommend importing the dataset through the [Single dataset](../single_dataset/index.rst)  option and then utilizing the [analyze](../single_dataset/analyze.md) tab to delve into specific characteristics. Similarly, if you wish to visualize specific items within the dataset, I recommend using the [visualize](../single_dataset/visualize.md) tab within the 'Single dataset' mode.

If you want to save an intermediate form of the dataset after applying multiple transforms while using DatumaroApp, you can press the 'Save' button at any time. The file will be saved with the timestamp of when you clicked 'Save'. It will be saved in the datumaro format, so remember that if you want to review it later.
