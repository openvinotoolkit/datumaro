# Visualize

If you want to directly visualize a specific item in the dataset, you can press the visualize tab. Pressing the visualize tab will display the following screen:

![Visualize Tab](../../../../images/gui/single/visualize_tab.png)

Select the subset of the data item you want to examine, then choose the item's ID to visualize the item's image and annotations. By default, you can view all annotations of the item, and you can adjust the transparency of annotations when plotting.

For detailed information on each method, please refer to the [visualize](../../jupyter_notebook_examples/notebooks/03_visualize.ipynb).
