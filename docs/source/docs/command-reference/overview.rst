Overview

The command line is split into the separate ``commands`` (:ref:`Context Commands`)
and command ``contexts`` (:ref:`Context-free Commands`).
Contexts group multiple commands related to a specific topic, e.g.
project operations, data source operations etc. Almost all the commands
operate on projects, so the ``project`` context and commands without a context
are mostly the same. By default, commands look for a project in the current
directory. If the project you're working on is located somewhere else, you
can pass the ``-p/--project <path>`` argument to the command.

.. note::

    **Note**: command behavior is subject to change, so this text might be outdated,
    **always check the ``--help`` output of the specific command**

.. note::

    **Note**: command parameters must be passed prior to the positional arguments.

Datumaro functionality is available with the ``datum`` command.

Usage:

.. code-block::

    datum [-h] [--version] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] [command] [command args]

Parameters:

- ``--loglevel`` (string) - Logging level, one of
  ``debug``, ``info``, ``warning``, ``error``, ``critical`` (default: ``info``)
- ``--version`` - Print the version number and exit.
- ``-h, --help`` - Print the help message and exit.
