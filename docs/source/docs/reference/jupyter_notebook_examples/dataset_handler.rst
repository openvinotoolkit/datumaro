Datumaro provides the dataset import and export functionalities.

When importing multiple datasets, Datumaro helps to manipulate and merge them into a single
dataset. Since the manipulations such as reidentification, label redefinition, or filtration are
mostly the topic of transformation, we here describe how to merge two heterogeneous datasets
through `IntersectMerge`.
