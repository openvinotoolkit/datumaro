# Extending

There are few ways to extend and customize Datumaro behavior, which is
supported by plugins. Check [our contribution guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/datumaro/blob/develop/contributing.md)
for details on plugin implementation. In general, a plugin is a Python module.
It must be put into a plugin directory:
- `<datumaro_dir>/plugins` for global plugins

## Built-in plugins

Datumaro provides several builtin plugins. Plugins can have dependencies,
which need to be installed separately.

### TensorFlow

The plugin provides support of TensorFlow Detection API format, which includes
boxes and masks.

**Dependencies**

The plugin depends on TensorFlow, which can be installed with `pip`:

``` bash
pip install tensorflow
```
or
``` bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
or
``` bash
pip install datumaro[tf]
```
or
``` bash
pip install datumaro[tf-gpu]
```

## Dataset Formats

Dataset reading is supported by Extractors and Importers.
An Extractor produces a list of dataset items corresponding
to the dataset. An Importer loads a dataset from the data source location.
It is possible to add custom Extractors and Importers. To do this, you need
to put an Extractor and Importer implementation scripts to a plugin directory.

Dataset writing is supported by Converters.
A Converter produces a dataset of a specific format from dataset items.
It is possible to add custom Converters. To do this, you need to put a Converter
implementation script to a plugin directory.

## Dataset Conversions ("Transforms")

A Transform is a function for altering a dataset and producing a new one.
It can update dataset items, annotations, classes, and other properties.
A list of available transforms for dataset conversions can be extended by
adding a Transform implementation script into a plugin directory.
