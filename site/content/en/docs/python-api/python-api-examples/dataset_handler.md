Datumaro provides the dataset import and export functionalities.

When importing multiple datasets, Datumaro helps to manipulate and merge. Since the manipulations
such as reidentification, label redefinition, or filtration are mostly the topic of transformation,
we here describe how to merge two heterogeneous datasets through `IntersectMerge`.
