This API allows you to visualize a dataset with media ids.

Although Datumaro supports various kinds of vision tasks, e.g., classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, 
key point estimation, visual captioning, etc., we provide a task-agnostic visualization tool.
That is, regardless of annotation types, `vis_gallery` describes the multiple annotation-overlapped images from a list of multiple media ids.
We can control the transparency of annotations over images by adjusting `alpha`.
